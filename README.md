# Speech-Processing-using-Fourier-Transformation
This project was made as a part of the course 'Summer Course - CS461 : Speech Processing'. Here, we take a noisy input which will processed and enhanced by removing the distortion from it. I have made use of Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) technique in it. Code is written in python3 as well as in MATLAB.

Input : sample.wav                  
Output : output.wav
